# PropertyFinder

### idea:

This will be a web app designed so that a user can manage and find new properties for an area that they like.
Features will include:
* Uploading a link to a supported site
  * Extract information about the price per month
  * any photos attached
  * description
  * contact information
* Store different properties in a table with rows
* reorder rows
* set up differen portfolios

This software will also be constantly checking for:
* If this property is no longer available
  * will let the user know with a pop up with a list of properties that have gone (acknowledge all button)
  * mark the background of that section red and put it into a 'hidden' section
* If the mode is set to finding mode, will look for properties (given a filter) and notify you when there are any properties that fit your description
